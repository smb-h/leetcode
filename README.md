# LeetCode
This repository is dedicated to solving LeetCode problems.

## Overview
This repository serves as a compilation of my solutions to various LeetCode problems. As I work through these coding challenges, I aim to enhance my problem-solving skills and deepen my understanding of algorithms and data structures.

## Folder Structure
The solutions are organized into folders based on the categories provided by LeetCode. Each folder contains the Python scripts corresponding to the solved problems. The file names are indicative of the problem's title or number.

## How to Use
1. Browse the folders to find problems of interest.
2. Open the Python file for a specific problem to view the solution code.
3. Comments within the code provide explanations and insights into the approach used.

## Contribution
If you have a different or more optimized solution, feel free to contribute! Follow these steps:
1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch (`git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name`).
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add your feature'`).
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/your-feature-name`).
5. Open a pull request.

Let's learn and grow together! ðŸŒ±
